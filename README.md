### Overview
<ul>
  <li>Performed extensive climate analysis using satellite datasets via <b>Google Earth Engine</b>.</li>
  <li>Focused on key environmental indicators: <i>Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)</i>, <i>Evapotranspiration</i>, and <i>Temperature</i>.</li>
  <li>Built <b>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</b> models to forecast climate trends and support evidence-based environmental planning.</li>
</ul>

### Key Findings
<ul>
  <li>All three predictive models indicated a slight but consistent increase in temperature over time.</li>
  <li>Quantitative and qualitative data analysis highlighted a noticeable warming trend, especially post-2010.</li>
  <li><b>1990</b> was identified as a significant year ‚Äî peak in temperature density observed, without El Ni√±o influence.</li>
  <li>Findings support the hypothesis that human activities contribute significantly to long-term climate change.</li>
</ul>

> üåç <b>CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.</b> The warming trend, coupled with historical atmospheric data, clearly indicates the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

### Tools & Technologies
<ul>
  <li><b>Google Earth Engine:</b> Satellite data access and geospatial analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Python, TensorFlow:</b> Climate modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</li>
  <li><b>Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn:</b> Data wrangling and visualization.</li>
</ul>

### Associated Institution
